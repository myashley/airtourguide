### Problem
Many people would like to travel by themselves, with friends, with families, but complete strangers. Joining a group tour with tight schedules, wasting time going to unwanted places, bearing with a big group of random tour members during their precious holiday time might seem like a nightmare.

At some places, people might need tour guides, which will help the travellers to know better about the places, explore more interesting places, and save some time from planning. However, we might not know which tour guides are available, whether the local tour schedule could fit into our travel plan, or whether these travel guides are the types of people we would like to travel with, and also paying them.

### Solution
“Air Tour Guide” provides a platform for people to look for local tour guides, either in advance or when in place. You are able to search the local tour guides that suit your preferences before you travel, or when you are just there. 

Upon requests, the app will match the tour guides that match the locality and time frame, and be able to filter by extra services offered by the travel guides such as bilingual services, driving, photography etc.

The app also provides opportunities for anyone who wishes to become a local tour guide, and conduct local tours to suit their capabilities with flexible schedule. The tour guides get paid to travel with a small group of people, work like taking friends to attractions or their secret local places, and making each tour a fascinating experience.
